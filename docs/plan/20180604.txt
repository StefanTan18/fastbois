Prioritization:
We have completed the setup of the buildings and the roads.
The most crucial step now is to complete the setup of the people and allow them to move around on the road.
We are also going to start working on the wayfinding algorithm that would involve backtracking. The people would travel only on the road and they would travel from their location to the a location where they would have to go, which is represented by an ID number that given to each strucure. We will use the ID number to identify each type of structure. We would need to work on the wayfinding algorithm together.
Once we get this core functionality done, we are able to add more types of buildings and allow the user to interact with GUI by adding buildings or people to where they desire. 

Chronology:
1. Person class
2. Wayfinding Algorithm (Make sure the people are able to travel freely first)
3. Extra Classes that we would like to add.

The wayfinding algorithm is expected to take a while and we expect to spend the most time on this part and we are prepared for setbacks that make occur when trying to implement this algorithm.
