Prioritization:
* We have fixed the initial setup procedures of the buildings and the roads.
* The most crucial step now is to complete to allow the people to move around between buildings.
* We are also going to start working on the wayfinding algorithm that would involve backtracking.
* We are planning on having a function to keep track of time so the people could leave at a certain time.
* We are also going to have the building constructors intialize people in them.
* Once we get this core functionality done, we are able to add more types of buildings and allow the user to interact with GUI by adding buildings or people to where they desire. 

Chronology:
1. Robustifying the Person class
2. Wayfinding Algorithm (Make sure the people are able to travel freely first)(and utilizing capacity queues on the road)
2b. government class, giving crucial stats and insights
3. Extra Classes that we would like to add.
4. more user interaction with the world
5. enhancements to existing classes

The wayfinding algorithm is expected to take a while and we expect to spend the most time on this part and we are prepared for setbacks that make occur when trying to implement this algorithm. We will also have to make it robust, to account for future additions to transportation options and in the far, far future, "personal" preferences
