Final Project Repo. 
## City Simulator
What makes a city a city? Is it the people who populate it? Is it the structures that exist? Cities exist all across the world; after all they are what makes our modern society possible. As fellow urbanites ourselves, we are part of a vast organism that is arguably just as  alive as its constituent parts(that is, humans). From New York to Mumbai, people flock to cities to seek out opportunities, and across the world, there are many striking similarities from city to city.

Based on that premise, can we model any city? Can we construct our own city, play around with it, and improve upon it? Can a super-complex, intricately linked aspect of human society be reduced to lines of code?

With our project, we aim to discover and answer that question with our **city simulation**.
## Description of Our Project
Our project will use Processing so that the user can visually interact with the City Simulator. In the display window, the user will be able to see the roads which are represented by the thin white rectangles create a grid in the display window, the buildings represented by squares of different other than white and black. These will include structures such as residential buildings, parks, and commericials buildings which you would see in a normal city. The user will also be able to see the citizens of the city interacting with each of the structures and the user will be able to see them commute to different places just as in a normal city. 
## Our Goal
The end goal, of course, is to create a reasonably accurate simulation that takes into account many factors, with a simple GUI output using processing and backend usage of data structures(such as a doubly linked list or a heap), to accurate visualize links in the complex web of a city. 
## Launch Instructions
1. Clone this repo. To clone this repo, open a terminal session and navigate to the folder you want this repo to located in. Then clone with SSH by typing in ```$ git clone git@github.com:StefanTan18/fastbois.git```
2. Navigate to the City directory.
3. Open City.pde using the Processing program.
4. Press the Play button once the window opens. 
5. Enjoy and watch the daily routines of a city occur right before your eyes.
