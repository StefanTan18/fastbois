Final Project Repo. 
## City Simulator
What makes a city a city? Is it the people who populate it? Is it the structures that exist? Cities exist all across the world; after all they are what makes our modern society possible. As fellow urbanites ourselves, we are part of a vast organism that is arguably just as  alive as its constituent parts(that is, humans). From New York to Mumbai, people flock to cities to seek out opportunities, and across the world, there are many striking similarities from city to city.

Based on that premise, can we model any city? Can we construct our own city, play around with it, and improve upon it? Can a super-complex, intricately linked aspect of human society be reduced to lines of code?

With our project, we aim to discover and answer that question with our **city simulation**.
## Our Goal
The end goal, of course, is to create a reasonably accurate simulation that takes into account many factors, with a simple GUI output using processing and backend usage of data structures(such as a doubly linked list or a heap), to accurate visualize links in the complex web of a city.
